## Leaflet Earthquake Visualization

# Overview

This project is designed to visualize earthquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) using Leaflet.js. The goal is to create an interactive map that displays global earthquake activity, helping to educate the public and government organizations about seismic activity and its impact.

# Features

- Fetch real-time earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON Feed.

- Display earthquakes on an interactive map using Leaflet.js.

- Customize markers based on earthquake magnitude (size) and depth (color).

- Provide detailed earthquake information via popups.

- Include a legend for better data interpretation.

# Getting Started

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

- A text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

# Installation

1. Clone this repository:

2. git clone https://github.com/yourusername/leaflet-challenge.git

3. Navigate to the project directory:

cd leaflet-challenge

Open index.html in your browser to view the visualization.

# Usage

- The map automatically pulls and displays the most recent earthquake data.

- Click on any marker to view additional earthquake details.

- The legend provides context for magnitude and depth representation.
